# us_medical_costs_project

This was a Codecademy Pro Portfolio project aimed at investigating U.S. medical insurance costs using a toy dataset. No specific instructions as to how to complete the project were provided by Codecademy. I investigated several trends in the data, carried out statistical analysis of those trends, and fit two supervised machine learning regression models to the cost data. My results are summarized in report format.

The report which summarizes my findings is included in this repository as "MAC_us_medical_insurance_costs_report.pdf."

The project itself was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the included "insurance.csv" dataset, and utilized Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, the SciPy package stats, the statsmodels package stats.multicomp, and the scikit-learn packages model_selection, preprocessing, linear_model, and neighbors in my analysis. The Jupyter Notebook file containing my analysis is included as "us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb."

The included file "insurance.csv" was downloaded from the following Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance. It is listed as an open database, hence why I am including it in this repository.
